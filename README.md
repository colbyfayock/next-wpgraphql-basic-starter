# Next.js WPGraphQL Basic Starter

## ⚡️ Quick Start

### Requirements
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
* [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)

```bash
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wpgraphql-basic-starter
# or
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wpgraphql-basic-starter
```

Add an `.env.local` file to the root with the following:
```
WORDPRESS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="http://yourhost.com/graphql"
```

In some cases, the above may not work.
Change it as follows:
```
WORDPRESS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="http://yourhost.com/index.php?graphql
```
